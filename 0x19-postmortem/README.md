my postmortem documentation


Overview:
On March 5, 2023, our system experienced a major outage that lasted for approximately 6 hours. The outage affected all of our customers, resulting in significant downtime and data loss. Our team worked tirelessly to resolve the issue and restore service as quickly as possible. We apologize to everyone who was affected. In this postmortem report, we will examine the root cause of the outage, the impact on our customers, and the steps we will take to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
Timeline:

2:30 AM:  Configuration push.
2:45 AM: Our team began investigating the issue and discovered that the root cause was a database failure.
3:15 AM: Failed configuration change rollback.
4:30 AM: We decided to escalate the issue to our database vendor for assistance.
5:15 AM: Our database vendor identified a hardware issue on one of the database servers, which caused the failure.
5:45 AM: The faulty server was replaced and the database was successfully recovered.
8:00 AM: Service was fully restored and all customers were able to access their data.
Root Cause:
The cause of the outage was a hardware failure on one of the database servers. The server was part of a redundant system, but the failure occurred during routine maintenance when the redundant system was off line. As a result, the backup system was unable to function properly, causing a cascade of errors that led to the outage.

Impact:
The outage inconvenienced all of our users, resulting in significant downtime and data loss. We are still assessing the extent of the data loss, to see if any has lost data irreversibly..

Mitigation and Future Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will take the following steps:

Disable the current configuration release mechanism.
Increase redundancy and fault tolerance in our database systems to minimize the impact of all future failures.
Implement more robust monitoring and alerting systems to act to issues more quickly.
 auditing all high-risk configuration option
Carry out  regular system maintenance during off-peak hours to minimize the risk of an outage during critical business hours.

Conclusion:
We sincerly  apologize for any  inconvenience created and damages caused by this outage..
